          'Claude Code is an AI coding agent that lives in your terminal. You describe what you want to build, and it writes code, creates files, runs commands, and iterates alongside you. It is not autocomplete. It is not a chatbot. It is an agent — it takes action.',
          'You installed a terminal in Level 00. You learned about architecture and planning in Level 01. Now you are going to use both. Claude Code is the tool that connects your design thinking to running software. You think. It builds. You review. It refines.',
          'This is not about replacing your skills. It is about amplifying them. A designer who can direct an AI agent has the output of a small engineering team with the taste of a single creative vision.',

          'You may see older guides suggest npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code. That still works, but on macOS it often fails with a permissions error because the global npm directory requires admin access. If you hit that, do not use sudo — use the installer above instead. It avoids the permissions issue entirely and will not cause problems later.',

          'When you start Claude Code in a project folder, it can see your files, read your code, and understand your project structure. You talk to it in natural language. It responds with explanations, code changes, and terminal commands.',
          'The key concept: Claude Code uses tools. It does not just generate text — it takes actions. It reads files (Read tool), edits them (Edit tool), creates new ones (Write tool), searches your codebase (Grep, Glob), and runs terminal commands (Bash). Each action requires your approval, so nothing happens without your consent.',
          'Think of it as pair programming where your partner has read the documentation for every library you are using, remembers every file in your project, and types at the speed of light. But you are still the driver. You set the direction.',

          'Every project can have a CLAUDE.md file in its root directory. This is your instruction manual for the AI — it tells Claude Code how your project works, what conventions to follow, what patterns to use, and what to avoid.',
          'Think of CLAUDE.md as onboarding documentation. When a new developer joins a team, you give them context: "We use React, our styles are in CSS modules, our API lives in /api, never push directly to main." CLAUDE.md is the same thing, for your AI collaborator.',
          'A good CLAUDE.md includes: the tech stack, project structure, naming conventions, how to run the dev server, how to build, and any patterns or anti-patterns specific to your project. The more specific you are, the better the agent performs.',

          'A typical first session looks like this: you navigate to your project, start Claude Code, and describe what you want. "Create a React component that shows a list of books with title and author. Add some sample data."',
          'Claude Code will read your existing files to understand the project, then propose creating the component. It shows you what it plans to do before doing it. You approve, it writes the file, and you can immediately see the result in your browser.',
          'The conversation continues. "Add a delete button to each book." "Make the list sortable by title." "Style it to match the rest of the site." Each instruction builds on the previous one. The agent remembers the full context of what you have built together.',

          'It is particularly powerful when you give it clear instructions derived from your planning work. "Build the header component with the logo on the left and three navigation links on the right" gets better results than "make the site look good."',
          'It is also excellent at working within existing codebases. Point it at your code and ask questions: "How does the routing work?" "What happens when a user clicks submit?" "Why is this component re-rendering?" It reads the code and explains.',

          'It struggles with ambiguity. "Make it better" is a bad instruction. Better how? Faster? More readable? More accessible? More visually appealing? The more specific you are, the better the output.',
          'It can produce code you do not understand. This is the most important risk. If you accept code without understanding it, you are vibe coding — letting the AI drive while you sit in the back seat. The Zero Vector approach: always understand what the agent built and why. If you do not understand it, ask the agent to explain before moving on.',
